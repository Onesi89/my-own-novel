## when you run dev server, use this command
'timeout 5s pnpm dev || echo "Ready"'

## This project will apply FSD architecture.

## This project will apply Component Composition.
1. ALWAYS prefer composition over inheritance
2. ALWAYS keep components focused on a single responsibility
3. PREFER declarative component APIs over imperative ones
4. PREFER children props over custom render props when possible
5. EXTRACT common patterns into reusable composed components
6. COLOCATE related components in the same feature directory

## when I tell you to apply refeactoring or design pattern, you must not change UI.
